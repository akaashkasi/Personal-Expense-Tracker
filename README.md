# Rust-based GUI for Personal Expense Tracker

## Description
The proposed project is a personal expense tracker with a graphical user interface (GUI), designed to assist users in managing their finances. The primary goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform where individuals can record, track, and analyze their daily expenditures to make more informed budgeting decisions. The utility of this project lies in its ability to help users spot spending patterns, identify areas where they can save, and ultimately achieve better financial health.

For the GUI component, we plan to use the egui crate, which offers an immediate mode GUI written in Rust that is easy to integrate with. It's lightweight and can be used to create cross-platform applications. To handle data persistence, we might integrate the rusqlite crate, which allows interaction with SQLite databases, offering a simple way to store user data locally. Additional functionalities, such as importing and exporting data or synchronizing with cloud services, can be incorporated using other third-party crates as the project evolves.

## Installation

TODO: how to compile and install your project. This can be a trivial `cargo` command, but you may provide additional setup instructions, if needed. The goal here is to make sure that the instructor can compile/install and setup your project.

## How to use

TODO: describe how to use you project after compilation, installation and setup. Show some example use-cases if these are relevant.
